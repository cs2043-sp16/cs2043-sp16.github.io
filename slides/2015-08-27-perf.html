## Reading Note

This is a supplement to [the notes](/2015/08/10/performance.html).

Go read them, too!

## How Fast Can We Go?

- Speed in flop/s for Linpack: [top500](http://www.top500.org)
  - Giga ($10^9$) -- a single core
  - Tera ($10^{12}$) -- a big machine
  - Peta ($10^{15}$) -- current top 10 machines (5 in US)
  - Exa ($10^{18}$) -- favorite of funding agencies
- Current record-holder: China's Tianhe-2
  - 33.9 Petaflop/s (54.9 theoretical peak)
  - 17.8 MW + cooling
</section>

## Tianhe-2 environment

Commodity nodes, custom interconnect:

- Xeon E5-2692 nodes with Phi accelerators
- Intel compilers + Intel math kernel libraries
- MPICH2 MPI with customized channel
- Kylin Linux
- *TH Express-2 interconnect*

## A US Contender

[Sequoia at LLNL (3 of 500)](http://www.top500.org/system/177556)

- 20.1 Petaflop/s theoretical peak
- 17.2 Petaflop/s Linpack benchmark (86%)
- 14.4 Petaflop/s in a bubble-cloud sim (72%)
  - 2013 Gordon Bell Prize
  - 2010 Prize was 30% peak on ORNL Jaguar
- Performance on more standard code?
  - 10% is probably very good!

## Parallel Performance in Practice

- Peak > Linpack > Gordon Bell > Typical
- Measuring performance of real applications is hard
  - Typically a few bottlenecks slow things down
  - Figuring out why can be tricky!
- And we *really* care about time-to-solution
  - Sophisticated methods get answers in fewer flops
  - ... but may look bad in flop rate benchmarks
- Lots of delusion and deception in performance analysis
  - Read [the notes]((/2015/08/10/performance.html)!

## Quantifying Parallel Performance

- Starting point: good *serial* performance
- Strong scaling: compare parallel to serial time (fixed size)
  - Speedup = Serial Time / Parallel Time
  - Efficiency = Speedup / p
  - Ideally, speedup = p; usually lower
- Barriers to perfect speedup
  - Serial work (Amdahl's law)
  - Parallel overheads (communication, synchronization)
</section>

<section>
<h2>Amdahl</h2>

\begin{align}
p = & \mbox{ number of processors} \\
s = & \mbox{ fraction of work that is serial} \\
t_s = & \mbox{ serial time} \\
t_p = & \mbox{ parallel time} \geq s t_s + (1-s) t_s/p
\end{align}

<br/>
$$
\mbox{Speedup} = \frac{t_s}{t_p} = \frac{1}{s + (1-s)/p} < \frac{1}{s}
$$

<br/>
<p>
  Things look better if $n$ grows with $p$ (a weak scaling study)

## Summary

- We're approaching exaflop *peak* rates
- Codes rarely get peak performance
- Better: Compare to tuned serial performance
  - Measure *speedup* and *efficiency*
  - Strong scaling: increase $p$, fix $n$
  - Weak scaling: increase both $p$ and $n$
- Serial overheads and communication kill speedup
- Simple analytical models help understand scaling
