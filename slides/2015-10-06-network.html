# CS 5220
## Distributed memory
### Networks and models
## 06 Oct 2015
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Basic questions

- How much does a message cost?
  -   *Latency*: time to get between processors
  -   *Bandwidth*: data transferred per unit time
  -   How does *contention* affect communication?
- This is a combined hardware-software question!
- We want to understand just enough for reasonable modeling.
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Thinking about interconnects

Several features characterize an interconnect:

-   *Topology*: who do the wires connect?
-   *Routing*: how do we get from A to B?
-   *Switching*: circuits, store-and-forward?
-   *Flow control*: how do we manage limited resources?
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Thinking about interconnects

-   Links are like streets
-   Switches are like intersections
-   Hops are like blocks traveled
-   Routing algorithm is like a travel plan
-   Stop lights are like flow control
-   Short packets are like cars, long ones like buses?

At some point the analogy breaks down...

<section>
<h3>Bus topology</h3>

<img width="60%" src="/img/topology/l7bus.svg"></img><br/>

<ul>
<li>One set of wires (the bus)</li>
<li>
  Only one processor allowed at any given time
  <ul>
    <li><em>Contention</em> for the bus is an issue</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Example: basic Ethernet, some SMPs</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h3>Crossbar</h3>

<img width="40%" src="/img/topology/l7xbar.svg"></img><br/>

<ul>
<li>Dedicated path from every input to every output
    <ul><li>Takes $O(p^2)$ switches and wires!</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Bus vs. crossbar

-   Crossbar: more hardware
-   Bus: more contention (less capacity?)
-   Generally seek happy medium
    -   Less contention than bus
    -   Less hardware than crossbar
    -   May give up one-hop routing

### Network properties

Think about latency and bandwidth via two quantities:

-   *Diameter*: max distance between nodes
-   *Bisection bandwidth*: smallest bandwidth cut to bisect
    -   Particularly important for all-to-all communication
</section>


<section>
<h3>Linear topology</h3>

<img width="40%" src="/img/topology/l7linear.svg"></img><br/>

<ul>
<li>$p-1$ links</li>
<li>Diameter $p-1$</li>
<li>Bisection bandwidth $1$</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Ring topology</h3>

<img width="40%" src="/img/topology/l7ring.svg"></img><br/>

<ul>
<li>$p$ links</li>
<li>Diameter $p/2$</li>
<li>Bisection bandwidth $2$</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h3>Mesh</h3>

<img width="40%" src="/img/topology/l7mesh.svg"></img><br/>

<ul>
<li>May be more than two dimensions</li>
<li>Route along each dimension in turn</li>
</ul>

</section>


<section>
<h3>Torus<h3>

<img width="40%" src="/img/topology/l7torus.svg"></img><br/>

<p>
  Torus : Mesh :: Ring : Linear
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h3>Hypercube</h3>

<img width="40%" src="/img/topology/l7cube.svg"></img><br/>

<ul>
<li>Label processors with binary numbers</li>
<li>Connect $p_1$ to $p_2$ if labels differ in one bit</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h3>Fat tree</h3>

<img width="40%" src="/img/topology/l7fattree.svg"></img><br/>

<ul>
<li>Processors at leaves</li>
<li>Increase link bandwidth near root</li>
</ul>
</section>

### Others...

-   Butterfly network
-   Omega network
-   Cayley graph

### Conventional wisdom

-   Roughly constant latency (?)
    -   Wormhole routing (or cut-through) flattens latencies vs
        store-forward at hardware level
    -   Software stack dominates HW latency!
    -   Latencies *not* same between networks (in box vs
        across)
    -   May also have store-forward at library level
-   Avoid topology-specific optimization
    -   Want code that runs on next yearâ€™s machine, too!
    -   Bundle topology awareness in vendor MPI libraries?
    -   Sometimes specify a *software* topology
