The video tutorials for Step 5 on the [Getting Started](http://cs2043-sp16.github.io/getting_started.html)
page are up.  There are two parts.  The first part applies to both VMs, and shows
you how to configure the VirtualBox application as well as a little bit about
how you use it.  Part 2 is separated into Ubuntu and Fedora videos.
