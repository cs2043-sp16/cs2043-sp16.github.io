## HW0: Getting Started
**Due: 2016-02-01**

Please follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](getting_started.html) page.  The only
part of the assignment that is officially being graded is just whether or not you have filled
out the google form linked in the GitHub section.

Of course, you will need to have your Unix environment setup and you should do this as soon
as possible.
