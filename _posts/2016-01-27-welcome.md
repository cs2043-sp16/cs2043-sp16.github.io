Welcome to CS 2043!  The weather may have prevented you from being in class today,
but you can still complete HW0.  You will need a reliable internet connection
to download the Virtual Machine if you need it.  Depending on how fast your internet
is, you may want to go grab some lunch while it downloads.

Please read through the Syllabus and get your Virtual Machine configured as soon
as possible.  You will need a functioning Unix environment in order to complete
the remainder of the assignments for this coures.
