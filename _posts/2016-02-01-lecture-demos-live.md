The lecture demos can be found at [https://github.com/cs2043-sp16/lecture-demos.git](https://github.com/cs2043-sp16/lecture-demos.git).
I updated the README.md to explain how we will be using it, as well as how to obtain it.  For now, `git clone` and `git pull` are the
only commands I endorse, we will learn more soon.  With that, go ahead and follow the directions there to download the latest changes
to the README.md locally to see how it works!
