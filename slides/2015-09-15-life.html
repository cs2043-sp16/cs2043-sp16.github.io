### Discrete events

Basic setup:

-   Finite set of variables, updated via transition function
-   *Synchronous* case: finite state machine
-   *Asynchronous* case: event-driven simulation
-   Synchronous example: Game of Life

Nice starting point — no discretization concerns!

<p style="text-align:left;">
Game of Life (John Conway):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Live cell dies with &lt; 2 live neighbors</li>
<li>Live cell dies with &gt; 3 live neighbors</li>
<li>Live cell lives with 2–3 live neighbors</li>
<li>Dead cell becomes live with exactly 3 live neighbors</li>
</ol>

<p>Easy to parallelize by domain decomposition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Update work involves volume of subdomains</li>
<li>Communication per step on surface (cyan)</li>
</ul>

### Game of Life: Pioneers and Settlers

What if pattern is “dilute”?

-   Few or no live cells at surface at each step
-   Think of live cell at a surface as an “event”
-   Only communicate events!
    -   This is *asynchronous*
    -   Harder with message passing — when do you receive?
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Asynchronous Game of Life

How do we manage events?

-   Could be *speculative* — assume no communication across
    boundary for many steps, back up if needed
-   Or *conservative* — wait whenever communication
    possible
    -   possible $\not \equiv$ guaranteed!
    -   Deadlock: everyone waits for everyone else to send
    -   Can get around this with NULL messages

How do we manage load balance?

-   No need to simulate quiescent parts of the game!
-   Maybe dynamically assign smaller blocks to processors?

### High-Performance Game of Life

 - Lots of implementations use fancy bit representations
 - [Ch 17](http://downloads.gamedev.net/pdf/gpbb/gpbb17.pdf) and
   [Ch 18](http://downloads.gamedev.net/pdf/gpbb/gpbb18.pdf) of
   Abrash's _Game Programmer's Black Book_ have an old, but still
   illuminating discussion of low-level (serial) optimizations
 - [HashLife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife) is a triumph
   of algorithm design.

### High-Performance Game of Life

How would I tackle this?  Assuming matrix version, I might:

 - Build a bit-packed representation
 - Use a fast vectorized kernel to update small blocks
 - Coarse blocking with generation skipping
 - Dynamic scheduling of coarse block updates

What would you do?
