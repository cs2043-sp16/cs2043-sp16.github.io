<p>Is this a fair portrayal of your CPU?</p>

## The idealized machine

![Smiley face](/img/Smiley.svg)

- Address space of named words
- Basic operations are register read/write, logic, arithmetic
- Everything runs in program order
- High-level language into "obvious" machine code
- All operations take about the same amount of time

## The real world

- Memory operations *not* all the same!
  - Registers/caches lead to variable access speeds
  - Memory layout affects performance (a lot)
- Instructions are non-obvious!
  - Pipelining allows instructions to overlap
  - Functional units run in parallel (and out of order)
  - Instructions take different amounts of time
  - Different costs for different orders/instruction mixes

Our goal: enough understanding to help the compiler.

## Prelude

Self-evident:

1. One should not sacrifice correctness for speed
2. One should not re-invent the wheel
3. Your time matters more than computer time

Less obvious, but still true

1. Most time goes to a few bottlenecks
2. Bottlenecks are hard to find without measuring
3. Communication is expensive (common bottleneck)
4. A little good hygiene will save your sanity
   - Automate testing, time carefully, use version control

## A sketch of reality

Today, a play in two acts:

1. [One core is not so serial](/slides/2015-09-01-parallel.html)
2. [Memory matters](/slides/2015-09-01-memory.html)
