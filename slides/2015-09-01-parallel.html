## Example 1: Laundry

- Three stages to laundry: wash, dry, fold
- Three loads: darks, lights, underwear
- How long will this take?
</section>


<section>
  <h2>How long will it take?</h2>
  <div class="quizzer">
    Three loads of laundry to wash, dry, fold.
    One hour per stage.  What is the total time?
    A: 9 hours
    =: You spend too much time on laundry
    A: 5 hours
    =: That's what I had in mind!
    A: 3 hours
    =: Maybe at a laundromat; what if only one washer/drier?
  </div>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## Setup

- Three *functional units*
  - Washer
  - Drier
  - Folding table
- Different cases
  - One load at a time
  - Three loads with one washer/drier
  - Three loads with friends at the laundromat

## Example 2: Arithmetic

$$2 \times 2 + 3 \times 3$$

> A child of five would understand this.  Send someone to fetch a child
> of five.

<h2>How long will it take?</h2>

<div class="quizzer">
  Suppose all children can do one add or multiply per second.
  How long would it take to compute $2 \times 2 + 3 \times 3$?
  A: 3 seconds
  =: OK, three ops at one op/s; what if there are multiple kids?
  A: 2 seconds
  =: OK, if two kids do the multiplies in parallel
  A: 1 second
  =: Not without finding faster kids!
</div>

</section>


<section>
<h2>One child</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>$2 \times 2 = 4$</td>
    <td>$3 \times 3 = 9$</td>
    <td>$4 + 9 = 13$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Total time is 3 seconds</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Two children</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>$2 \times 2 = 4$</td>
    <td>$4 + 9 = 13$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$3 \times 3 = 9$</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Total time is 2 seconds</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Many children</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>$2 \times 2 = 4$</td>
    <td>$4 + 9 = 13$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$3 \times 3 = 9$</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Total time remains 2 seconds = sum of latencies for
  two stages with a data dependency between them.

<section data-markdown>
## Pipelining

- Improves *bandwidth*, but not *latency*
- Potential speedup = number of stages
  - What if there's a branch?
- Different pipelines for different functional units
  - Front-end has a pipeline
  - Functional units (FP adder, multiplier) pipelined
  - Divider often not pipelined
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## SIMD

- Single Instruction Multiple Data
- Old idea with resurgence in 90s (for graphics)
- Now short vectors are ubiquitous
  - 256 bit wide AVX on CPU
  - 512 bit wide on Xeon Phi!
- Alignment matters
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## Example: [My laptop](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.6-13-late-2013-retina-display-specs.html)

MacBook Pro (Retina, 13 in, Late 2013)

- [Intel Core i5-4228U (Haswell arch)](http://ark.intel.com/products/75991/Intel-Core-i5-4288U-Processor-3M-Cache-up-to-3_10-GHz)
- Two cores / four HW threads
- Variable clock: 2.6 GHz / 3.1 GHz TurboBoost
- Four wide front end (fetch+decode 4 ops/cycle/core)
- Operations internally broken down into "micro-ops"
  - Cache micro-ops -- like hardware JIT?!
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## My laptop: floating point

- Two fully-pipelined multiply or FMA per cycle
  - FMA = Fused Multiply Add: one op, one rounding error
- [256 bit SIMD (AVX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions)
- [Two fully pipelined FP units](http://www.realworldtech.com/haswell-cpu/4/)
  - Two multiply or Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) per cycle
  - Only one regular add per cycle
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## Peak flop rate
  
- Result (double precision) $\approx 100$ GFlop/s
  - 2 flops/FMA
  - $\times 4$ FMA/vector FMA = 8 flops/vector FMA
  - $\times 2$ vector FMAs/cycle = 16 flops/cycle
  - $\times 2$ cores = 32 flops/cycle
  - $\times 3.1 \times 10^9$ cycles/s $\approx 100$ GFlop/s
- Single precision $\approx 200$ GFlop/s

</section>


<section data-markdown>
## Reaching peak flop

- Need lots of *independent* vector work
  - FMA latency = 5 cycles on Haswell
  - Need $8 \times 5 = 40$ *independent* FMA to reach peak
  - Great for matrix multiply -- hard in general
- Still haven't [talked about memory!](/slides/2015-09-01-memory.html)
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## Punchline

- Special features: SIMD, FMA
- Compiler understands how to use these *in principle*
  - Rearranges instructions to get good mix
  - Tries to use FMAs, vector instructions
- *In practice*, the compiler needs your help
  - Set optimization flags, pragmas, etc
  - Rearrange code to make obvious and predictable
  - Use special intrinsics or library routines
  - Choose data layouts + algorithms to suit machine
- Goal: You handle high-level, compiler handles low-level
