Formalities aside, at its core this class is a supplemental tool to enable
you to be more comfortable with developing effectively.  Though the tools
you are learning are specific to Unix, understanding how to use them translates
(in the general sense) to other platforms as well.  For example, if you
have learned Object Oriented Programming in Java, then you essentially know
the concepts necessary to do Object Oriented Programming in Python.  The
differences are primarily just the syntax (the words you type).  Those of you
who will develop in Windows in the future will still benefit from this course,
noting that *for the most part* most of the tools you are learning in
this course have an analgous tool in [Windows Powershell](https://www.penflip.com/powershellorg/a-unix-persons-guide-to-powershell).
By the end of this course, you will be able to parse the previous link and
understand how to translate your Unix knowledge to Windows, if you even decide
to go back!
