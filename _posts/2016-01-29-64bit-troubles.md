Some of you have been unable to import the 64bit VMs I have prepared.  On the [Getting Started](getting_started.html)
page below Step 5 there is a new section "Help!  I can't get a 64bit VM working".  This will provide you with
instructions on how to get a 32bit VM setup.  If your computer is particularly old, or you have not been able to
configure your BIOS to enable VT-x (for Intel) or Hyper-v (for AMD), try setting up the 32bit VM instead.
